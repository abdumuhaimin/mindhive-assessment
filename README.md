# MindHive Full Stack Python Developer Assessment Project

I had so much fun building this project as it requires me to think outside of the box and since I had experience building API using Flask and BeautifulSoup, I had no trouble completing the tasks given within a short timeframe.




# Roadmap
I began planning for this project right after I received the LinkedIn message from Johnson who sent me a PDF containing this project's requirements. After reading the requirements, I began drafting the idea on how to solve the problems faced as described.

## Planning
During the planning stage, I gathered the rough idea on what the app will look like. Is it going to be a web app? Or an analytics dashboard? After understanding the requirements, I decided it is the former that we're after.

## Execution
I began developing part by part - beginning with scraping the data from Zus Coffee website, to storing it in a local SQLite database and building the API. After I have finished developing the API, I faced my first hurdle: front-end.

I had experience with developing React applications before, but it's been long since I developed one for the past year. Alas, I quickly refresh my memory by finishing up a few YouTube videos on React and voila! I managed to integrate Leafy to generate a dynamic map for this project. In the end, I ended the development with a smile knowing I have successfully overcome the obstacle.

### Closing
Closing phase includes deployment to Heroku, writing documentations and readme (which is what I'm doing right now). This part of the plan is very important as it tells a story or some sort of a journey novel of what the developers faced during the development and it can assist in installlation too! Which is what we will cover next.



## Tech Stack

**Client:** ReactJS

**Server:** Flask, SQLite

## Prerequisites
Python 3.10 and above
Node.js v18.1 and above
